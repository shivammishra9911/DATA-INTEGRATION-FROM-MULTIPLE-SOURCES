## **🔍 In-Depth Analysis of Ride-Booking Data**  

### **1️⃣ Total Bookings Overview**  
- **📊 Total Bookings:** **103,024**  
- This is the total number of rides booked in the dataset.  

**🚖 Insight:**  
- A high number of bookings suggests an active user base and frequent ride requests.  
- However, we need to check the distribution of successful vs. failed bookings.

### **2️⃣ Booking Status Breakdown**  
- **✅ Successful Bookings:** **62.09%**  
- **❌ Canceled by Driver:** **17.89%**  
- **❌ Canceled by Customer:** **10.19%**  
- **🚫 Driver Not Found:** **9.83%**  

**🔹 Insights:**  
- **Driver Cancellations (17.89%)** are quite high. Possible reasons:  
  - Long wait times or unprofitable rides.  
  - Driver unavailability in certain areas.  
  - Surge pricing causing drivers to cancel lower-paying rides.  
- **Customer Cancellations (10.19%)** may be due to:  
  - High wait times.  
  - Change of plans.  
  - Unexpected pricing changes.  
- **Driver Not Found (9.83%)** indicates:  
  - Shortage of drivers in some locations.  
  - System inefficiencies in ride allocation.  

📌 **Actionable Steps:**  
- Analyze peak hours and cancellation patterns.  
- Improve driver supply in low-availability areas.  
- Implement better incentives for drivers.

### **3️⃣ Revenue Analysis**  
- The **total revenue** and revenue distribution are important indicators.  
- If revenue is concentrated in a few cities or times, **adjusting pricing models** could help balance demand.  

📌 **Recommendations:**  
- Introduce **dynamic pricing** based on demand.  
- Provide **discounts or loyalty incentives** to increase customer retention.  
- Encourage **driver participation** in off-peak hours.

### **4️⃣ Ratings & Customer Satisfaction**  
- The **average rating** gives insights into rider experience.  
- If **ratings are lower in certain locations or times**, service quality issues need to be addressed.  

📌 **Key Areas to Analyze:**  
- Are lower ratings correlated with long wait times?  
- Do certain **vehicle types** get better ratings than others?  
- Are specific drivers or regions contributing to lower ratings?  

**Solutions:**  
- Provide training to drivers to enhance service quality.  
- Optimize algorithms for better ride-matching.

  - Seasonal variations (e.g., higher rides on weekends or holidays).  
  - Peak hours (morning/evening rush).  
  - Growth patterns (is demand increasing over time?).  

📌 **Actionable Insights:**  
- Identify **low-demand periods** and offer promotions to boost rides.  
- Use **AI-based demand prediction** to better allocate drivers.

### **6️⃣ Vehicle Type Distribution**  
- The dashboard includes a breakdown of **vehicle types** (e.g., standard, premium, shared).  
- If **certain types** have higher cancellations or low ratings, adjusting the fleet composition can improve efficiency.  

📌 **Suggestions:**  
- If **shared rides** have high cancellations, consider modifying pricing or incentives.  
- If **premium rides** have fewer bookings, check if the pricing is too high.

### **7️⃣ Data Sources & Integrity**  
- Data is coming from **Excel, SQL, OneLake, and Dataverse**.  
- Ensuring **real-time data synchronization** across all sources is crucial for accurate insights.

## **📌 Final Takeaways & Next Steps**  
✔ **Reduce driver cancellations** by analyzing ride acceptance patterns.  
✔ **Increase driver supply** in areas with high “Driver Not Found” cases.  
✔ **Improve customer experience** by addressing rating patterns.  
✔ **Optimize pricing & incentives** for both customers and drivers.  
✔ **Use predictive analytics** to balance supply and demand effectively.
